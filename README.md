## Beta Testing

To gain access to the Fangagement Crouchjump beta app, you will need to have sent us a valid email address that you want to use in the app, and an invite sent to you from us for the beta versions of the app.

### Downloading on IOS

To use the app on IOS, you will need to download the Testflight app from the App Store, and redeem the Testflight invitation code sent to your email address. Once redeamed, you can download the Crouchjump mobile app and register a new account.

### Downloading on Android

To use the app on Android, you will need to open the invite email on your mobile device and click on the link. At the store page you can download the Android version of the app. Once downloaded you can register a new account from within the app.

### Registering a Crouchjump Account

After opening the app you can register by pressing the "Sign Up" button. After filling out your account information and submitting (Make sure the email you sign up with is the one you provided us with originally), you will be sent a verification email to the email you specified in the registration form. Pressing the link in the email will take you back to the app and you will be logged in now.

### Reporting Issues

If while using the app you notice any bugs or UI issues you can report them here on this Github repository by navigating to the Issues tab, and creating a new issue.

A reported issue should include as much information as you can provide in order for us to be able to reproduce it so that we can resolve it. If the issue is a graphical/UI issue then please make sure to provide a screenshot or recording of the problem.

Before submitting an issue, please scan through the existing issues and make sure that the issue that you are reporting is not a duplicate, and if it is then click the details for that issue and add any additional information if you have any, or just leave a comment stating that you are also seeing this issue.
